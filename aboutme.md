While wearbale technology may not be a necessity at the moment, the growth of using electronic textiles could see the rise in a new use of technology. With the presence of e-textiles, there are more areas in which we can integrate this form of technology into our everyday lives. That is why I have decided to explore a field of computer science currently offered at Williams College. With no prior experience in Computer Science, follow along as I discover my strengths and weaknesses within e-textiles!
