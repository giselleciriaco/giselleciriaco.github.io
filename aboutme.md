title: About me
subtitle: Journey in Electronic Textiles!
---

My name is Giselle Ciriaco and I am a first year at Williams College. With my major undeclared at the moment, I am exploring different areas of study to potentially find a major that suits me. Hence why I am taking a course on Electronic Textiles! E-textiles combines three categories that I have not yet explored: Computer Science, Digital Circuits, and Sewing. 

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
