For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a program that has three sets of LEDs light up in three differrent blinking patterns. These LEDs mimic flashing patterns that three different fireflies have (which can be found in the Great Smoky Mountains). The flashing patterns occur simultaneously.

In order to have a smooth time with coding, I recommend writing down variables you may need and really just writing down what you are supposed to do. It makes it easier to understand when you write down what you have to do in your own words. Once you start coding, it is important to test your code frequently to prevent an error from appearing late in the process!
