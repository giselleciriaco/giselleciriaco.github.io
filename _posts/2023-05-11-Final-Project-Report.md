Final Project: Break Time, Work time Wristband

Taking what I learned throughout the semester, I created the Break Time, Work Time Wristband for my final E-textiles assignment! Procrastination is no fun and I am a victim of it. I start doing work for 15 minutes and then my break turns from 5 minutes to 30 minutes and then eventually I find myself cutting it close to the deadline. In order to attempt on improving with my time management, I wanted to create something that keeps me in check. Something that would allow me to improve my bad habbits.  

So what is the Break Time, Work Time Wristband? How does it work? The Break Time, Work Time wristband allows one to manage their time better and efficiently when completing tasks and assignments. When the switch is on, LEDs will turn on. The level of brightness for the blue LED is determined by the intensity of light in the current moment. This is able to happen using ther Light Sensor. As for the buzzer, after 30 minutes (30 seconds for the demo), the buzzer will make sound with BREAK in Morse code. It will go off for 5 minutes (15 seconds for the demo). This means that when there is no sound, that means it is time to do work. When there is sound, it means it is break time. This will only work when the switch is on. When the switch is in the off position, it just becomes a simple wearable wristband. 

Materials:

2 LilyPad LEDS (1 red and 1 blue)
1 Arduino Board
Conductive Thread 
2 Snap Buttons
1 Buzzer
1 SwitchS
1 Light Sensor
Scissors, Sewing Needles, Non conductive Thread, Felt

Tips: 

Be patient! It will take a long time and every step of the process is important so don't try to skip over any steps!
Use nonconductive thread to hold down pieces into place. It makes it a lot easier when you start sewing with conductive thread. This organization also makes sure you can avoid any short circuits if components are held into place
Use resources like class slides and coding cheat sheets to complete the coding components of the project. These resources provide much help when you are confused why your code does not want to work.
