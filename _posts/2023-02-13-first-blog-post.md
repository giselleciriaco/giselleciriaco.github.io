Hello! My name is Giselle Ciriaco and I am a first year at Williams College. With my major undeclared at the moment (currently leaning towards Psychology), I am exploring different areas of study to potentially find a major that suits me. Hence why I am taking a course on Electronic Textiles! E-textiles combines three categories that I have not yet explored: Computer Science, Digital Circuits, and Sewing. I have no experience in sewing so that may be my biggest challenge in this courseFollow along as I branch out into the worl of electronic textiles! While I also have zero experience in programming, I think I will be able to understand programming better than my attempt in sewing. I hope to learn the skill of sewing to potentially have it as a new hobby. While I would say I am a pretty interesting person, most of my personality comes from being the youngest in my family. Follow along as I continue to find my potential major!
