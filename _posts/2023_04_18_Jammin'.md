For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a program that would play a song when the slide switch is in the on position. I struggled throughout the assignment so I would say focus on coding a few lines at a time or else you will be finding an error when you asssume to be close to finishing. Maybe my choice in tune was also not the best but we move on!
