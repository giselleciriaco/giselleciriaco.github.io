For this assignment, I had to write a C-program that mimics the behavior of the LEDs in our plushy assignement. The behavior of the LEDs whether they were on or off depended on the 'button' and 'switch'. All 3 LEDs were on when the button was pressed and the switch was on. This was a great practice using nested if.. else statements. I realized that taking coding line by line makes it easier for me to understand what I am trying to get out as a result and it minimizes by ability to make man errors along the way.
