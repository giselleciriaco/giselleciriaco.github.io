In this assignment, I was tasked to create a C-program that will print out the users' meal options dependent on whether it's the regular or secret menu and the meal option. With the proper coding, the output should be an item off either the secret menu or the regular menu. In my example, a menu off the secret menu was provided from the coding.
Given that I struggled in keeping track of the number of curly brackets there were, I would suggest to focus on having the right number of brackets. Make sure that each bracket has its partner that way there will not be an error in your code and it makes it visually easier.
