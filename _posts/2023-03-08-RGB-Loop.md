For this assignment, i was tasked with writing a C-program that uses a loop that simulates turning various LEDs lights on by printing the color of the LED. Every 10th time through the loop, the program prints either RED, GREEN, or BLUE. Each color gets printed three times but only on the 10th time through the loop. Above is the output of my program!
One tip I would give is to keep track of the brackets and semi-colons. Sometimes an opening bracket was missing a closing one and sometimes I forgot to provide a semi-colon when I needed to. Make sure you are able to run through your code wither in your head or on paper with it making sense before actually running it through!
