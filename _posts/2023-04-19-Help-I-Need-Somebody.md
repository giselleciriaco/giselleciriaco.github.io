I was given the task to create a program that emits the Morse code for my name via the Buzzer but switches to emitting SOS in Morse Code when the circuit is closed. Therefore the program executes one of two different functions. 
One tip is to really describe the steps of your coding. Using the single line comments helps stay organized and helps you remember/understand what each part of your code means!
