For this assignemnt, I was tasked with creating a circuit with one LED and two homemade switches. One switch would be from conductive thread patches and the other from additional material. For my second switch, I decided to use a paper clip. With my circuit working correctly, the LED only turns on when both switches are closed, or pressed together. One tip I would give for this projeect is to use tape or non-conductive thread to hold down the parts like the battery holder and LED. It just makes it much easier to work as the objects are not moving around too much while you are sewing.
