**Why I am taking Electronic Textiles**

Did you know that Levis released a smart jean jacket in partner with Google? What seemed to be a fail instead sparked up a conversation on wearable technolgy. While wearbale technology may not be a necessity at the moment, the growth of using electronic textiles could see the rise in a new use of technology. With the presence of e-textiles, there are more areas in which we can integrate this form of technology into our everyday lives. That is why I have decided to explore a field of computer science currently offered at Williams College. With no prior experience in Computer Science, follow along as I discover my strengths and weaknesses within e-textiles!


Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
