For this assignment, I was given the task to create an Arduino program that uses arrays to elicit random behavior from PWM pins. This means thats for every one second, a new anolog pin would be chosen to write to. A different LED would turn on with a different value.
I suggest having resources like the Arduino Cheat sheet on deck because it really helped me remember what exactly each function did and how to write it properly. Sometimes you need a refresher in order to proceed with your coding. All in all, use your resources!
